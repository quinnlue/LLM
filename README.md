I was in the middle of my life when I met my future self. He had been diagnosed with cancer and he knew that there were many things to be grateful for, but one thing stood out most: his new friend.

He had always wanted to be my friend so much that it seemed like every time we talked about something important or interesting, he would say "thank you." He never really cared if anything happened because he just felt so good knowing that everyone else around him wasn't too bad at what they did together!

So after being through this whole process all over again, I decided to give up on him completely. I didn't want to let him down any more than ever before giving up entirely.

And then, as I thought about it now, I realized how much I needed him - even though I know I wouldn't have done that without him. I could not help myself from thinking that everything might go wrong during this entire journey.

Now, I'm glad to hear that I finally gave up hope...but still, I couldn't resist taking solace in the fact that I could do something truly special once again.

As I was reading this book, my heart started to race around the room as I listened intently for clues about what was going on in the world that day.

I felt like I had been transported into a different dimension of reality by an ancient alien who lived tens of thousands of years ago and gave us all his wisdom!

My brain went through some really weird things when I began to read books again... but it wasn't until after I'd finished reading the first chapter that I realized how much more bizarrely fantastical my thoughts were than they should be at any moment.

And then I remembered something: my mind is so fucking crazy because of these strange creatures living inside our bodies....and yet we're still mesmerized with them now!!!!!

So yeah, I loved reading books back then -- especially those that told stories about aliens or supernatural beings from the past!

But alas, I have no idea why I've not become one since then. I just know that there's nothing quite like it anymore without knowing the answers too :)
